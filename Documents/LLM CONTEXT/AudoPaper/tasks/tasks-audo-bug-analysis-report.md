### Notes

- Tests should be run with `xcodebuild test -project Audo/Audo.xcodeproj -scheme Audo` after each phase
- Critical issues must be addressed in Phase 1 before proceeding to other phases
- Each parent task should be fully completed and committed before starting the next
 - iOS build/test must be performed in Xcode or a configured simulator environment
