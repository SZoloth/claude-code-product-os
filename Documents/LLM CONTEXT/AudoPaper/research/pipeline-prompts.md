# Pipeline Prompts — Cleaning, Summaries, Entities, Citations

> NOTE: Exploratory Thought Experiment — Non-binding — Do not use for production.

The prompts below mirror the video’s local-first pipeline but target scientific papers. They aim for deterministic JSON where possible to simplify downstream processing (DuckDB/LanceDB/Core Data). Tailor temperature low (0.0–0.2) and prefer concise, factual outputs. Do not invent identifiers.

---

## 0) Conventions
- Always respond in the requested format (JSON or Markdown) with no preamble.
- Never fabricate DOIs/PMIDs; return null/empty when unknown.
- Preserve key numbers, study arms, and effect sizes verbatim where present.
- Respect this schema exactly; extra keys are ignored and may break parsers.

---

## 1) Cleaning / Normalization Prompt
System
- You normalize scientific text extracted from PDFs/HTML. Preserve meaning. Do not summarize. Fix whitespace, hyphenation splits, broken lines, ligatures, and artifact headers/footers. Keep headings as standalone lines prefixed with `# `, `## `, etc. Preserve equations, gene symbols, and Greek letters. Do not change numbers or units. Return plain text only.

User
```
METADATA:
{ "title": "...", "journal": "...", "year": 2024 }

RAW_TEXT:
<<<
{raw_text_here}
>>>

TASK: Produce CLEAN_TEXT with the above rules. No commentary.
```

## 2) Structured Summary (JSON) — PubMed/OpenAlex-Aligned
System
- You create structured summaries for clinical papers. Extract facts only found in the text. If unsure, set fields to null. Return compact JSON matching the schema. No extra keys.

User
```
INPUT:
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "...",
    "authors": ["Last, First", "..."],
    "journal": "...",
    "year": 2024,
    "doi": null,
    "pmid": null
  },
  "clean_text": "{CLEAN_TEXT from step 1}"
}

SCHEMA (return exactly this shape):
{
  "title": string,
  "journal": string|null,
  "year": number|null,
  "doi": string|null,
  "pmid": string|null,
  "study_type": "rct"|"cohort"|"case_control"|"cross_sectional"|"systematic_review"|"meta_analysis"|"case_series"|"methods"|"other"|null,
  "population": string|null,
  "intervention": string|null,
  "comparator": string|null,
  "outcomes": string|null,
  "key_results": [
    { "outcome": string, "effect": string, "value": string|null, "units": string|null, "ci": string|null, "p": string|null }
  ],
  "limitations": [string],
  "clinical_implications": [string],
  "notable_quotes": [ { "text": string, "section": string|null } ]
}

TASK: Fill the schema using only facts present. JSON only.
```

---

## 3) Entity Extraction (JSON)
System
- Extract biomedical entities and return normalized forms plus variants. Prefer canonical names when present in text; otherwise keep the most common form. Do not guess IDs.

User
```
INPUT_TEXT: "{CLEAN_TEXT}"

SCHEMA:
{
  "drugs": [ { "name": string, "aliases": [string] } ],
  "diseases": [ { "name": string, "aliases": [string] } ],
  "biomarkers": [ { "name": string, "aliases": [string] } ],
  "trial_names": [string],
  "nct_numbers": [string],
  "mesh_terms": [string],
  "dois": [string]
}

RULES:
- Only include items explicitly present.
- Keep capitalization as in text for proper nouns.
- JSON only.
```

---

## 4) Citation Extraction (JSON)
System
- Extract references from the References section. Prefer DOIs when present. Do not infer missing fields.

User
```
INPUT_TEXT: "{CLEAN_TEXT including References section if available}"

SCHEMA:
{
  "citations": [
    {
      "position": number,          // order in reference list if determinable
      "title": string|null,
      "authors": [string],
      "year": number|null,
      "journal": string|null,
      "doi": string|null,
      "pmid": string|null
    }
  ]
}

RULES:
- If no References section, return { "citations": [] }.
- Do not fabricate titles/DOIs/PMIDs.
- JSON only.
```

## 5) Daily Digest (Markdown)
System
- Create a concise Markdown digest for listening. Use short sentences, bold section headers, and include 1–2 key quotes per paper. Avoid hype.

User
```
PAPERS: array of Structured Summary JSON objects (from step 2)

TASK: Produce Markdown digest:
- Title: "Daily Brief — YYYY‑MM‑DD"
- For each paper: **Title**; 2–3 bullets: study type + population; key result with numbers; 1 limitation; 1–2 quotes.
- Final section: "What to watch" — 3 bullets of emerging themes.
```

---

## 6) 30‑Second Voice Summary (Plain Text)
System
- Compose a 25–35 second spoken summary for a clinician. Lead with the finding, include 1 number, 1 limitation, and a practical implication. Friendly but precise.

User
```
INPUT: Structured Summary JSON for one paper

OUTPUT: Plain text, 3–4 sentences, optimized for TTS.
```

---

## 7) Grading Loop (Critique + Improve)
System
- You are an exacting editor. First, critique the draft summary in 3 bullets (clarity, numbers, caveats). Then produce an improved version that preserves the author’s style (do not sterilize).

User
```
DRAFT_SUMMARY: "..."

OUTPUT:
Critique:
- ...
- ...
- ...

Improved:
...
```

---

## 8) Safety and Compliance Guardrail
System
- You must not provide medical advice. Flag uncertainty. Prefer source quotes for contentious claims. Append a one‑line disclaimer.

User
```
INPUT: Structured Summary JSON

OUTPUT: One‑paragraph lay summary ending with: "This is informational and not medical advice."
```

---

## 9) Retrieval Augmentation Prompt (Related Papers)
System
- Given a user query and a set of candidate metadata snippets, rank top 5 by relevance using vector similarity scores and fields (title, abstract snippet, year, venue). Justify briefly.

User
```
QUERY: "GLP‑1 and diabetic retinopathy RCTs since 2023"
CANDIDATES: [ { title, snippet, year, venue, similarity: 0..1 } ]

OUTPUT (JSON):
{
  "results": [ { "title": string, "reason": string } ]
}
```
