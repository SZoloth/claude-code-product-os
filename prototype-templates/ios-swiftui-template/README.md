   ```

2. **Open in Xcode:**
   ```bash
   open ProjectNamePlaceholder.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Update Configuration:**
   - Change `PROJECT_NAME_PLACEHOLDER` to your app name
   - Update `BUNDLE_ID_PLACEHOLDER` to your bundle identifier
   - Set `TEAM_ID_PLACEHOLDER` to your development team ID
   - Replace `PROJECT_AUTHOR_PLACEHOLDER` with your name

4. **Build and Run:**
   - Select your target device/simulator
   - Press `Cmd + R` to build and run

## 🏗️ Architecture

The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern:

- **Models**: Data structures and business logic
- **Views**: SwiftUI views and UI components
- **ViewModels**: State management and view logic
- **Services**: API calls, data persistence, and external integrations

### State Management

The app uses SwiftUI's built-in state management:
- `@State` for local view state
- `@StateObject` and `@ObservableObject` for shared state
- `@EnvironmentObject` for dependency injection
- `@Published` for reactive data binding

### Network Layer

The `NetworkManager` provides:
- Generic request methods with Combine
- Error handling and response mapping
- Image loading and caching
- Network connectivity monitoring

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run unit tests
Cmd + U

# Or via command line
xcodebuild test -scheme ProjectNamePlaceholder -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
```

### UI Tests
```bash
# Run UI tests
# Select the UI test scheme and press Cmd + U

# Or run specific UI test
xcodebuild test -scheme ProjectNamePlaceholder -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' -only-testing:ProjectNamePlaceholderUITests
```

### Test Structure
- **Unit Tests**: Test models, view models, and services
- **UI Tests**: Test user flows and accessibility
- **Performance Tests**: Test app launch and scroll performance

## 🎨 Customization

### Colors and Themes
- Modify `Assets.xcassets/AccentColor.colorset` for accent color
- Update `Constants.swift` for custom color schemes
- Colors automatically adapt to light/dark mode

### Typography
- Custom fonts can be added to the project
- Typography constants are defined in `Constants.swift`
- Use `Font.custom()` for custom typefaces

### Navigation
- The app uses `TabView` for main navigation
- Each tab has its own navigation stack
- Add new tabs by modifying `ContentView.swift`

## 🌐 Localization

To add localization support:

1. **Add Localizable.strings:**
   ```
   File → New → File → iOS → Resource → Strings File
   ```

2. **Use localized strings:**
   ```swift
   Text("welcome_message")
   ```

3. **Configure supported languages in project settings**

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
The app supports different configurations for development, staging, and production:

- API base URLs
- Feature flags  
- Analytics keys
- Third-party service configurations

### Build Configurations
- **Debug**: Development build with logging
- **Release**: Production build optimized for App Store

## 📱 Deployment

### TestFlight
1. Archive the app (`Product → Archive`)
2. Upload to App Store Connect
3. Distribute to internal/external testers

### App Store
1. Create app listing in App Store Connect
2. Upload screenshots and metadata
3. Submit for review

### CI/CD with GitHub Actions
The template includes GitHub Actions workflows for:
- Running tests on pull requests
- Building and archiving releases
- Automated deployment to TestFlight
