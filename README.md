# 🚀 Rapid Prototype Template System

**The bulletproof, idiot-proof, repeatable system for going from idea to interactive prototype in minutes.**

Never think about project setup again. One command creates production-ready foundations for web, mobile, and backend applications.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### First Time Setup
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/SZoloth/rapid-prototype-templates.git
cd rapid-prototype-templates

# Make the script executable (if needed)
chmod +x rapid-prototype.sh
```

### Create Projects  
```bash
# Create any type of project with one command
./rapid-prototype.sh

# Follow the interactive prompts:
# 1. Select project type (React, iOS, Python, Full-Stack)
# 2. Enter project details
# 3. Watch magic happen ✨
```

That's it. Your production-ready project is created, configured, and ready for development in Cursor.

- Open in Xcode and check signing settings
- Update team ID and bundle identifier

**AI workflow not working**
- Ensure you've copied ai-dev-workflow to your project
- Follow the markdown guides step-by-step

### Getting Help

1. Check the generated project's README.md
2. Look at CLAUDE.md for AI coding guidance  
3. Check GitHub Issues in generated projects
